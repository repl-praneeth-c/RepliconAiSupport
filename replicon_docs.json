    "content": "API authentication\nTo make calls against your Replicon instance, you'll need to authenticate or authorize access to the instance.\nAuthenticating on reference pages\nYou can\ntest calls\nusing the\nreference pages\n, providing:\nYou are logged in to Replicon and have a reference page open in the same browser, and\nYour instance's 'swimlane' (the three digits preceding\n.replicon.com\nin its URL, like\nsb1\n,\nna7\n,\neu1\n, etc) matches the swimlane shown in the reference page's URL\nIf you access the reference pages using most links in this user guide, you'll automatically be prompted to log in to Replicon before being sent to the reference page, and the swimlane of the reference page should automatically update to match that of your instance.\nHowever, if, when testing, you want to:\nUse the curl responses provided on the reference pages, or\nUse another user's level of\ndata access\n,\nyou should authorize access using\ntoken-based authentication\nAuthorizing using token-based Bearer authentication\nAcquiring a token\nTo generate a token:\nOpen the\nSecurity API reference page\n.\nYou will be prompted to log into your Replicon instance before you can access this page. This way, the reference page will be automatically authenticated for use with your instance.\nExpand the POST /AuthenticationService1.svc/CreateAccessToken2 operation.\nYou must have an\nAdministrator\npermission set\nassigned to use this operation.\nClick\nTry it out\n, and paste the following into the edit space:\n{\n\"identity\": {\n\"loginName\": \"admin\"\n},\n\"description\": \"Token for testing export app\",\n\"unitOfWorkId\": \"001\"\n}\nYou can update the login name in the identity parameter; when you use the token, you'll have access to all data the user you submitted has access to.\nYou must use a unique string in the\nunitOfWorkId\nfield each time you generate a new token; the API will always return the same result the ID was originally associated with. So, if you don't update the ID, each new call will return the same token.\nClick\nExecute\n.\nA successful request will return a token. The token shouldn’t expire, unless you included the\nLifetime\nfields when generating it.\nBe sure to keep your token secure, as it allows access to your Replicon data.\nAuthorizing a reference page using the token\nYou'll need to enter the token on each reference page you want to test from.\nWhen using token-based authentication, note that:\nThe token won't work if you're logged in to Replicon using the same browser; if you're logged in, the\nAPI\nwill default to using the credentials of logged in user, not the ones associated with the token.\nFor token-based authentication to work, the 'swimlane' (the three digits preceding\n.replicon.com\nin its URL, like\nsb1\n,\nna7\n,\neu1\n, etc) in the URL of the reference page you're working on must match the swimlane in the URL of your Replicon instance.\nTo authorize a page using a token:\nCopy this token, and open the\nreference page\nyou want to test from.\nClick\nAuthorize\n, and paste the token into the\nValue\nfield.\nClick\nAuthorize\n, then click\nClose\n.\nNow, when you carry out\ntest operations\n, the curl data should be usable, and access should be limited by the user associated with the token.\nAuthorizing programmatic calls\nIf you want to make calls programmatically, you’ll first need to authenticate using token-based Bearer authentication. Refer to the following for examples of how to format this type of authentication:\nPython\nNode.js\nRuby\nC#\nBest practices for coding programmatic calls\nThe swimlane in URL must be correct to authenticate\nEach Replicon instance is hosted on a particular swimlane (sometimes called an endpoint). In the URL https://X.replicon.com/services/, X represents the swimlane, which could be NA2, NA4, EU1, etc, making the URL read https://na3.replicon.com/services/ or similar.\nThe swimlane assigned to an instance may change from time to time, and the API can only be accessed from your instance’s swimlane.\nSo, it’s a good idea to include a check in your code, and generate the web service URL dynamically each time you perform a call. And, if you’re having authentication errors, check that you’re accessing the services from the correct swimlane.\nYou should always include application context with each call\nWhen making a programmatic call, we recommend you reference the purpose of the call in the\nX-Replicon-Application\nfield of the header. And, each time you make a call of this type, that you include this same context in the\nX-Replicon-Application\nfield. Maintaining this practice helps with troubleshooting.\nFor example, if the goal of a call is to add, retain, or remove user profiles, to keep them sync with Replicon, you could include this statement in the header:\n\"X-Replicon-Application\":\"CompanyKey_UserSynchronization_1.0\"\nYou'd include this same context any time you add or update users.\nFAQs\nI received an\nAll access checks failed to authorize operation\nerror\nIf you see an error like this: All access checks failed to authorize operation '<name of operation>' : At least one of the following permissions are required: ‘<name of permission>’, you’re missing permissions required to perform the operation in question.\nFor any operation carried out using services, you’ll need the same permissions and products you need to carry out that operation manually within the app. For information on assigning\nproducts\nand\npermissions\n, select the links.\nWhy can’t we use basic authentication?\nWe don’t support basic authentication since it doesn’t work with certain features, such as multifactor authentication.\nRelated links\nIntroduction to the Replicon and Polaris API\nUsing the API\nGetting started with Replicon and Polaris' API\nViewing the available API operations\nTesting your API calls",

    "content": "Introducing ZeroTime™\nReplicon’s ZeroTime\nTM\napp helps employees\ncomplete their timesheets\n.\nZeroTime versus traditional timesheets\nTraditional timesheets have a few potential drawbacks:\nThey can be inaccurate\nWith\ntraditional timesheets\n, employees record time every week or two, so they may have trouble remembering the details of the work they completed.\nThis makes filling out a timesheet inaccurate, since workers have to make their best guess about what they worked on.\nZeroTime\nautomates the collection\nof work details, so employees don’t have the chance to forget what they worked on.\nThey can be error-prone\nTraditional timesheets\nare completed manually, which inevitably results in errors.\nZeroTime\nautomates assembly\nof timesheet content, and optionally,\napplication of that content to the timesheet\n. It also\nlearns\nwhat details go with each type of work, limiting the manual entry required.\nThey can be labor-intensive\nWith a\ntraditional timesheet\n, if an employee works on a lot of projects, they have to add row upon row of data to their timesheet.\nSome companies even need to use spreadsheets to collect timesheet details, because they have so many entries to deal with.\nZeroTime\nautomatically groups and consolidates entries for the same type of work, which reduces the number of entries workers have to manage, and saves time and hassle. Plus, ZeroTime\nmachine learning\nspeeds up data entry.\nHow does ZeroTime work?\nAdministrators and end users enable what we call ‘collectors’, one for each commonly-used business app – like Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, or Zoom. Then, these collectors gather data from all activities the employee carries out using those apps.\nThe goal is not to track an employee’s every move, but to gather together data that will assist them in accurately populating their timesheet, so they don’t have to remember everything.\nManagers and administrators don’t have access to the data assembled from collectors, only the end user does\n.\nThe end user always acts as the final gate-keeper, deciding exactly what does or doesn’t appear on their ‘public’ timesheet. Plus, as always, they can edit data within their timesheet.\nZeroTime learns the user's work patterns, so it can make time-saving suggestions\nZeroTime can do much more than gather information to add to timesheets; ZeroTime uses machine learning to understand, over time and usage, the likely connections between actions users take and their timesheet tasks.\nSo, for example, if whenever you meet with Jill Doe via Zoom, you bill that time to Client X, over time ZeroTime will automatically associate any Zoom meeting with Jill Doe as a Client X task.\nTimesheets can be set to Auto Populate\nOptionally, users can set their ZeroTime account to\nAuto Populate mode\n. In this mode, their collected data is validated through machine learning and moved into their timesheet automatically.\nRelated links\nZeroTime Quick Reference Guide\nSetting up ZeroTime\nUnderstanding ZeroTime data collectors\nUsing ZeroTime to fill in your timesheet\nSetting up and managing data collectors in ZeroTime\nUnderstanding and managing machine learning in ZeroTime",
